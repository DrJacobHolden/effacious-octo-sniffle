# effacious-octo-sniffle
For an SE325 project. Will hopefully be an activisim webservice.

This project can be run by using the Maven Install goal. This will initially run all the tests in WebServiceTest.java and JaxbTest.java. There are also tests in DomainTest.java which show a much larger
set of functionality which was not implemented in Jax-RS due to time constraints (and sanity constraints). In order to run these follow the instructions in DomainTest.java.

Thanks for reading the readme. :)
